In this final project we write two C programs a client and a server to implement a remote shell connection using sockets. The server process's and the client process will run on two different machines and the communication between the two processes is achieved using Sockets. This project was a partial requirement to complete the course - Advanced Systems Programming at the University of Windsor

We used dup2() to read from the client socket instead of standard input.

We simulated load balancing by redirecting first 5 requests to server A and the other 5 to server B
